# Milestone 10
A theme that features the look of early Mozilla builds (M4-M10), using a mix of the original ones and a few that are created from scratch in order to achieve a nice look.

This theme uses [Classic Base](https://github.com/FranklinDM/Classic-Base) as a base.

## Building
Simply download the contents of the "src" folder and pack the contents into a .zip file. Then, rename the file to .xpi and drag into the browser.

## Download
